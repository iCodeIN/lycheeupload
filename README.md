# Lychee Upload
A command line tool for uploading photos in a directory or from iPhoto/Aperture libraries to a [Lychee](http://github.com/electerious/Lychee) installation on a remote server via SSH.
Based on [lycheesync](https://github.com/GustavePate/lycheesync) by Gustave Pat√© and [Phoshare](https://code.google.com/p/phoshare/) by Google. 


# Description

Performs a batch image import from a location on hard drive or from an iPhoto/Aperture library to the Lychee installation on a remote server via SSH. When importing from a directory, subdirectories are automatically converted to Lychee albums. As Lychee does not support sub-albums, photos in subsubdirectories are uploaded to the respective album. Photos in the root directory are uploaded to the Unsorted album. In the iPhoto/Aperture mode you can specify what to export. Possible options are events, albums and smart albums.
If you want to replace albums in the Lychee database, then you can use *-r* option. All photos in the existing album will be deleted in the Lychee database and replaced with new ones from the hard drive location.

# Installation

First retrieve project either by downloading it from here or if you have git installed, then checkout the project

`git clone https://github.com/r0x0r/lycheeupload`

Install the following 

- Python 2.7
- mysql-connector-python
- paramiko
- Pillow

## Debian based Linux

`sudo apt-get install imagemagick python python-paramiko python-imaging python-mysql.connector git`

## OSX

Installing dependencies on OSX is a bit trickier.

First you have to have Command Line Tools for Xcode installed. Go to [Downloads for Apple developers](http://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action), download and install Command Line Tools for Xcode.

Install *pip* if you do not have it already

`sudo easy_install pip`

Finally install dependencies using *pip*

`sudo pip install mysql-connector-python paramiko Pillow`


# Usage

`python lycheeupload.py [-h] [-d DIR] [-r] [-p] [-v] username@hostname:path`

General options

- `username@hostname:path` Server connection string with a full path to the directory where Lychee is installed. 
-  `-h`, `--help`            show a help message
-  `-r`, `--replace`         replace albums in Lychee with local ones
-  `-p`, `--public`          make uploaded photos public
-  `-v`, `--verbose`         print verbose messages

Directory import  options

-  `-d DIR`, `--dir DIR`     path to the photo directory where to export photos from.

iPhoto / Aperture options

-  `--iphoto [path]`         Import from iPhoto. If path is not provided, then default location is used.
-  `--aperture [path]`       Import from Aperture. If path is not provided, then default location is used.
-  `-e [pattern]`, `--events [pattern]` Export matching events. The argument is a regular expression. If the argument is omitted, then all events are exported.
-  `-a [pattern]`, `--albums [pattern]` Export matching regular albums. The argument is a regular expression. If the argument is omitted, then all events are exported.
-  `-s [pattern]`, `--smarts [pattern]` Export matching smart albums. The argument is a regular expression. If the argument is omitted, then all events are exported.
- `--originals`           Export originals instead of modified images
-  `-x pattern`, `--exclude pattern` Don't export matching albums or events. The pattern is a regular expression.

At very least you must specify a connection string and a source where photos should be imported from (`--dir`, `--iphoto` or `--aperture` options). 

For example to import photos from the directory */home/user/photos/* to the remote server *example.com* with Lychee installed in the */home/user/mydomain.com/* directory, issue the following command

`python lycheeupload.py -d /home/user/photos/ user@example.com:/home/user/mydomain.com/`

Import all events from the default iPhoto library location (~/Pictures/iPhoto Library)

`python lycheeupload.py --iphoto --events user@example.com:/home/user/mydomain.com/`

Import all the albums starting with the word "Summer" from the Aperture library located in *~/Pictures/My Aperture Library*

`python lycheeupload.py --aperture "~/Pictures/My Aperture Library" --albums "Summer.*" user@example.com:/home/user/mydomain.com/`
